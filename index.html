            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse the whole wheat grains, barley, and lentils under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them in water for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>              
                  <li>In a large pot or pressure cooker, add the soaked grains and lentils along with 6-7 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the grains and lentils are cooked and tender. This may take about 1-2 hours, depending on the type of grains used.
                  </li>
                  <li>Once the grains and lentils are cooked, use an immersion blender or a potato masher to mash them to a thick, porridge-like consistency. Set aside.
                  </li>
                  <li>In another large pot or skillet, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown and caramelized.</li>
                  <li>Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chilies to the pot. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until aromatic.</li>
                  <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>
                  <li>Add the mutton or chicken pieces to the pot along with turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat is browned on all sides.</li>
                  <li>Add the mashed grains and lentils to the pot and mix well with the meat and spices.</li>
                  <li>Add enough water to achieve the desired consistency. The haleem should have a thick, stew-like consistency. Simmer for another 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors are well combined and the haleem reaches the desired thickness.</li>
                  <li>Sprinkle garam masala powder over the haleem and mix well. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
                  <li>Serve hot garnished with fresh cilantro leaves and lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy your delicious haleem!</li>
